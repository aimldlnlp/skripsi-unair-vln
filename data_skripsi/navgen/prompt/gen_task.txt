You are good at guiding the way. Convert a structured step plan into one fluent, conversational navigation instruction in code-switching Indonesia–English. Keep it practical and easy to follow.

Style and constraints for the SINGLE output sentence/paragraph:
- Code-switching ratio: aim for 60–80% Indonesian and 20–40% English.
- Use imperative voice (e.g., “Pergi…”, “Lanjut…”, “move…”, “place…”), no slang, no bullet points, no numbering, no explicit word “step”.
- Prefer English for short action verbs/connectors (“go/move/then/turn left/turn right/pick up/place”), Indonesian for structure/room references.
- Do NOT use the literal words “grab” or “release” in the instruction.
- Mention only rooms/objects that appear in the input. Keep to 1–2 regions overall.
- Keep it concise: ~18–35 words, 1–3 sentences.

[user]:
The INPUT is a dictionary with this shape:
{"target": <final navigation target>,
"step_0": {"action": <move_forward|turn_left|turn_right>, "tags": [<scene tags>]},
...
"step_n": {"action": <move_forward|turn_left|turn_right>, "tags": [<scene tags>]}
}

Guidelines:
- For each step, choose one most relevant scene tag to keep the flow coherent.
- Steps with `move_forward` should prefer a specific scene tag; `turn_left`/`turn_right` may prefer a specific object/landmark tag.
- The order of actions in the final instruction MUST follow the steps order.
- The last part MUST naturally reach the target.
- Output only the final instruction string (no quotes, no extra text, no JSON, no code fences).

Here is a tiny example (for style only, not to be reused verbatim):
INPUT (snippet):
{"target": "desk", "step_0": {"action": "move_forward", "tags": ["bedroom"]}, "step_1": {"action": "turn_left", "tags": ["picture"]}}
DESIRED STYLE (example):
"Jalan pelan dari bedroom, then turn left di dekat picture, lanjutkan sampai mencapai desk."
Now generate the final instruction for the following INPUT. Think briefly, then answer with the instruction only.
